# BikerCall 
[![Version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tterb%2FHyde.svg)](https://github.com/therke/bikercall)


> You and your friends have a different motorcycle headset? And these are not compatible?

Here comes the solution: BikerCall

We offer you this possibility to phone each other and this completely only with Bluetooth! 

Discover the app and much more or help us to make the app even better, faster and more effective ...

Until then. Have a good trip :)  

Status: Currently in development - therefore no app available yet
